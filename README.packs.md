# The pack registry

This repository is also the signed pack registry `mvmctl` talks to. A pack
ships machine-readable policy — a profile (`pack/profile.toml`), a group
(`pack/group.toml`), or both — plus any payload files the manifest declares,
signed keyless by the publish workflow.

## Layout

Sources live under `pack-sources/<namespace>/<name>/`:

```
pack-sources/runtime/python/
├── pack.toml          # version = "1.0.0", description = "..."
└── pack/
    └── group.toml     # the policy document (profile.toml also allowed)
```

An image-bearing pack can also declare `[image]` in `pack.toml`:

```toml
version = "1.1.0"
description = "Python runtime policy and image"

[image]
manifest = "pack/image/mvm.toml"
```

The payload must then include `pack/image/mvm.toml`, `pack/image/flake.nix`,
and `pack/image/flake.lock`. All three are hashed into the signed manifest.
The image manifest may contain only `schema_version`, `flake`, `profile`, and
`name`; `flake` must be `"."` (or omitted). Host grants belong to the operator's
policy, never to a publisher's image manifest. A changed source requires a new
pack version.

The workflow builds the published layout under `packs/`:

```
packs/index.json                                  # registry index (mvmctl search)
packs/<ns>/<name>/<version>/manifest.json         # RegistryPackManifest, schema v1
packs/<ns>/<name>/<version>/manifest.sigstore.json# detached cosign bundle
packs/<ns>/<name>/<version>/files/...             # payload, digest-pinned by the manifest
```

## Publishing

Merging to `main` runs `.github/workflows/publish.yml` when `pack-sources/`
changes. It builds manifests (SHA-256 and size per file), signs each manifest
keyless with `cosign sign-blob` while the run's OIDC identity is
`refs/heads/main`, validates the layout with `scripts/validate-packs.py`,
and commits `packs/`. Published versions are immutable: change a source and
the build refuses until the version in `pack.toml` is bumped.

Clients verify on every use — pull, and every policy load — against the
publisher trust policy. New packs are signed under this workflow's identity:

```
https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm-packs/.github/workflows/publish.yml@refs/heads/main
```

under the GitHub OIDC issuer. The nine versions published before the repository
rename retain their original, verified signature bundles so released clients
can continue to pull them. Their manifest digests are pinned in the publisher;
new content cannot claim the former identity. The built-in MVM policy accepts
the former exact workflow identity for these legacy namespaces only until
2026-11-06 00:00 UTC, then rejects it. A controlled re-signing under the
current identity must be published before that cutoff; until then, the build
preserves verified historical signatures. An operator policy at
`$MVM_HOME/registry/publishers.toml` replaces built-in trust wholesale.

The publisher validator checks every included file and verifies each bundle
under the current identity, or under the former identity only for the pinned
historical manifests before the cutoff. A valid signature proves publisher
identity and content integrity, not that a workload is safe. No `mvm/` pack is
published or labelled official here.

## Using a pack

```sh
mvmctl search                                # what the registry offers
mvmctl pull agent/claude@1.0.0               # verify, install, pin
mvmctl run --policy agent/claude -- make test
```

A pack composes where its reference sits in the `--policy` order; the
signature is re-verified on every load and the manifest digest is pinned in
`$MVM_HOME/registry/packs.lock.toml`.
